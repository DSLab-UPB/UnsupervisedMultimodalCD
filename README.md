# Unsupervised Multimodal Change Detection

Development of ACE-NET deep-neural-network based on [ArXiv papper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04271.pdf)

Uses `Flood_UiT_HCD_California_2017_Luppino` as training database.

Test the model using `python main.py -c checkpoints/epoch=249-step=21999.ckpt --patch_size 250 --verbose`
